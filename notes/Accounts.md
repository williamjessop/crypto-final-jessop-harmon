### Ethereum Accounts
There are 2 types of Ethereum Accounts. External and Contract accounts.


#### External Accounts
External accounts are just like bitcoin accounts. These kinds of accounts are owned by users and are typically just wallets that hold some amount of [[Ether]]. This Ether can be exchanged with other external accounts or can be used with contracts.


#### Contract Accounts
Contract accounts are accounts that live on the blockchain. They can exchange Ether with other contracts or external accounts. Contract accounts do not have an owner and can be interacted with by most anyone.
