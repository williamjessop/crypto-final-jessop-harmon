## Project Description
For this project, we deployed our own NFT contracts to the Ethereum *Ropsten* testnet blockchain. We began by following simple tutorials and deploying the code that we found online. We then made a simple restriction on the contract that we found online and deployed that contract as well. 

The project runs in nodejs and makes use of many different libraries and services as described below. The contract code is written in the programming language Solidity.

---

## Project Structure
Much of the code in this repo is based on example code found on ethereum.org and hardhat.org. Some of the files were also autogenerated by Hardhat. The second commit in the repository shows code that was autogenerated with the command `npx hardhat`.

#### Contracts Folder

The folder with the most interesting code is the contracts folder. This folder contains the Solidity code that we deployed to the Ethereum testnet chain. The code in "Greeter.sol" was an example that was autogenerated by Hardhat. You can see that example code [here](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#compiling-your-contracts). The code in "MyNFT.sol" is based on this [NFT tutorial](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/). 

We added a restriction to the MyNFT contract that only allows a single NFT to be minted. This allowed us to create our final project token. 

#### Scripts Folder
This folder contains driver code that Hardhat can use to deploy Ethereum contracts. The code in "sample-script.js" was autogenerated by Hardhat. The code in "deploy-NFT.js" was based on this "sample-script.js" code. 

The code in "generateAddress.js" is based on a tutorial we found [here](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-sdks/how-to-generate-a-new-ethereum-address-in-javascript). This utility gave us the ability to create an Ethereum wallet without signing up for an outside service. 

The code in the "mint-NFT.js" file is based on the [NFT tutorial](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/) code. We changed the code to find the NFT contract address to use to be loaded from the process env variables.

#### Test Folder
This folder contains the testing scripts used throughout the project. The code in "sample-test.js" was autogenerated by Hardhat during its initialization. The code in "nft-test.js" was written by us and based on "sample-test.js". 

#### The Configuration Files
In the root of the repository, there are 3 configuration files. The "package.json" and "package-lock.json" files are autogenerated by npm for managing dependencies in a nodejs project. Also in the root of the repo, you will find a "hardhat.config.js" file. The majority of this file was autogenerated by Hardhat. We modified the file with our configuration for an external network (AKA Alchemy). For the project to work, one would also need to add a ".env" file in the root of the repo that would contain application secrets like API keys and Ethereum address private keys.

#### Notes Folder
The notes folder was for us to keep track of what we were learning about Ethereum and NFT's. This folder does not serve a purpose for the code. The notes are stored in markdown and we view them with an app called Obsidian.

## Tools used
### Alchemy
For this project, we used a suite of different tools. We did not start our own Ethereum node and instead, we connected to a service known as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com). This service allowed us to make Ethereum API calls without hosting our own full node. This service provides similar functionality to the Coinbase APIs.

### Hardhat
Hardhat is the set of development libraries we used to automate the deployment and testing of our contract code. It is a commonly used Ethereum JS client library that wraps commonly used actions into API calls that make life easy. Hardhat relies on other dependencies such as web3 (A JS+Ethereum extension) and Ethers.js (Another JS+Ethereum extension).

### S3
We used a service from Amazon Web Services known as the Simple Storage Service (or S3) to publicly host assets that we made NFT's out of. A better approach would be to use a decentralized filesystem like IPFS or a service that specifically hosts NFT content. However, we instead decided to use S3 because it was no additional cost to us and we already had access to AWS.

### Testing W/ Mocha
To test our contract code we used the default library that is chosen by Hardhat. This happens to be the JS testing library known as Mocha. In addition to Mocha, we made use of some custom test matchers that are included from Hardhat.

### Additional Tools
There are a handful of other pieces we used to make this project work. 

We used a library known as dotenv to manage our environment and secret keys. 

We used a tool known as [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/) to find our transactions and contracts on the test chain.

We also used 2 Ethereum faucets to get test coins for our project. They can be found here:

## Making our NFT
During this project, we took many attempts at deploying a proper NFT. We first began by deploying the "Greeter" contract that was autogenerated by Hardhat. This gave us
